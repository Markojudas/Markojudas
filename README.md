### Hello There!
My name is Jose Hernandez and these here are my repos. You will find my progress as I learn new technologies and different programming languages. I have some personal projects in here too, like the cshelp and bookmark tool which I use almost on a daily basis. I currently hold 2 bachelors in Psychology and Computer Science and I aim to work as a software engineer/developer. Security is also a space I am very much interested in.
